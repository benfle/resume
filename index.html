"We hired Benoit to work on some very technically challenging projects with open-ended and ambiguously defined objectives due to the nature of the work. He jumped in and delivered outstanding results quickly and consistently, with excellent communication throughout the engagement. Benoit is a highly intelligent and very skilled software engineer, and I hope to work with him again in the future" — Ryan Crum, CTO

I engineered a web application to crawl county web sites, extract the data from PDF tax forms using OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and store them in a relational database. I designed and engineered a simple web interface to query the data set and review the daily reports.

<h3 id="sec-3-2">Mobile ad delivery protocol</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
I designed two versions of our mobile ad delivery protocol. I educated my coworkers and the management about the REST architectural style. I drove adoption of JSON as an alternative to XML to represent ads. I designed a REST-based ad delivery protocol supporting XML and JSON. The approach has further been validated by our early compliance to the API guidelines of the entire advertising group.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-3">
<p>
Events are fundamental in an ad delivery engine. They're used for counting, logging, tracing, debugging&#x2026; I designed and proposed an object-oriented event system for the platform. I participated to the engineering of the system. The "aspect-oriented" design helped in simplifying the source code.

<p>
Based on my previous experience at ScreenTonic, I proposed the creation of a support tool to manually build queries to our ad platform. The tool is used by the support team to troubleshoot potential issues. I specified and engineered the web-based tool which proved to be very valuable to both support and development teams by reducing the number of interactions between them.

The mobile ad client library is a high-performance, low resource usage C library for fetching and managing ads on mobile devices: Windows Mobile 6.x, iPhone and Android.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<p>
As features were added, the configuration of ad campaigns got complex and it became hard to predict the behavior of the campaigns over time. We needed a tool to communicate between the production associates and the developers. I proposed to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_for_Integrated_Test">Framework for integrated test</a>. I engineered the tool and wrote the test fixtures for the existing features.

<h3 id="sec-5-3">Ad publishing protocol</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
Several times a day, the production associates needed to publish their ad campaigns from ScreenTonic's ad manager, a web-based application, to the ad server, a web service that delivers the ads to the mobile web publishers. I designed a HTTP API (standard error codes (4xx, 5xx), SSL + basic authentication). I proposed the adoption of RDF to describe the ad campaigns. I implemented an object-oriented API in PHP to generate and navigate ad campaigns. I provided code examples for publishing ad campaigns from the ad manager. I delivered a detailed documentation for the protocol.

<p>
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_of_voice">share of voice</a>-based delivery algorithm we were using had disadvantages in some extreme cases. I was asked to propose a new algorithm. I wrote a white paper on the state of the art of ad delivery. I implemented prototypes in python to test several algorithms. I proposed a new algorithm for the ad server. However, the company was acquired before the algorithm went into production.

Logging is one of the critical areas in an ad delivery platform. Our custom built logging mechanism across instances was starting to show its limits in term of scalability and reliability. I reviewed several bus messaging systems. I delivered a detailed white paper about <a href="http://spread.org/">the Spread Toolkit</a>. I proposed a road map to integrate the toolkit into our technology stack. However, the company was acquired before the integration work started.
